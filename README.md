Caesar Cipher Text Encryptor/Decryptor

📌 Project Overview
This project is a Python-based implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique used to encode and decode text by shifting letters of the alphabet by a fixed number. The program allows users to encrypt or decrypt messages either from the console or a file, and outputs results directly or to a file.

💡 Features
Encrypt or decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm

Input message via:

Console

Text file

Output encrypted/decrypted message to:

Console

output_2408485.txt file

Robust error handling for invalid inputs

Handles both uppercase and non-alphabet characters (they remain unchanged)

🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: Python

Module Used: os (for file existence checking)

🚀 How It Works
User is welcomed with a brief description of the tool.

User selects whether to encrypt (e) or decrypt (d) a message.

User decides the source of the message:

c: Console input

f: File input

User provides a shift number.

The program performs the encryption/decryption.

If a file was used, output is saved to output_2408485.txt.

User is prompted if they want to process another message.
