Caesar Cipher Text Encryptor/Decryptor

📌 Project Overview
This project is a Python-based implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique used to encode and decode text by shifting letters of the alphabet by a fixed number. The program allows users to encrypt or decrypt messages either from the console or a file, and outputs results directly or to a file.

💡 Features
- Encrypt or decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm

- Input message via:

    + Console

    + Text file

- Output encrypted/decrypted message to:

    + Console

    + output_2408485.txt file

- Robust error handling for invalid inputs

- Handles both uppercase and non-alphabet characters (they remain unchanged)

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Language: Python

- Module Used: os (for file existence checking)

🚀 How It Works
1. User is welcomed with a brief description of the tool.

2. User selects whether to encrypt (e) or decrypt (d) a message.

3. User decides the source of the message:

    + c: Console input

    + f: File input

4. User provides a shift number.

5. The program performs the encryption/decryption.

6. If a file was used, output is saved to output_2408485.txt.

7. User is prompted if they want to process another message.
